# Audio Deepfake Classification

This project focuses on building a deep learning model for classifying audio files as either genuine (bonafide) or manipulated (spoof). The objective is to detect audio deepfakes, which are manipulated audio recordings designed to impersonate a genuine audio source. The ASVspoof 2019 dataset is used for training and evaluating the model.
